This repo is based on Stephen Griders Webpack tutorial https://www.udemy.com/webpack-2-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/overview

My intent is to add the webpack modules and functionality I would like to use in my future projects, like TypeScript and SASS.

The master branch is focused on a setup I intend to use, with React/JSX, SASS plugins and entry points.

The tutorial branch is mainly the result of the turorial mentioned above, and which I used as starting point for configuring webpack, package.json etc
